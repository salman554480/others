		"description": "StartFragment\n\n#### Overview:\n\nThis API collection offers a powerful suite of tools designed to calculate the distance between two geographic locations and estimate travel times based on various modes of transportation. It provides real-time calculations for distances in kilometers, and estimates the travel time for different transport modes, including plane, train, car, bike, and walking. This API is perfect for applications requiring geographic analysis, travel planning, logistics, or location-based services.\n\n#### Key Features:\n\n- **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two locations based on their latitude and longitude using the **Haversine Formula**.\n    \n- **Travel Time Estimation**: Estimate travel time based on the following modes of transportation:\n    \n    - **By Plane**: Using an average plane speed of 800 km/h (commercial airplane cruising speed).\n        \n    - **By Train**: Using an average train speed of 100 km/h.\n        \n    - **By Car**: Using an average car speed of 100 km/h (highway conditions).\n        \n    - **By Bike**: Using an average cyclist speed of 20 km/h.\n        \n    - **By Walking**: Using an average walking speed of 5 km/h.\n        \n- **Geocoding**: Convert latitude and longitude coordinates into human-readable location names using **Nominatim** or any other geocoding service.\n    \n- **Real-Time Calculation**: The API performs real-time calculations, providing instant feedback for distances and estimated travel times based on user input.\n    \n- **Flexible Input**: Accepts coordinates (latitude and longitude) for start and end locations, which makes it suitable for any location-based service.\n    \n\n#### Benefits:\n\n- **Comprehensive**: Provides multiple travel modes, making it suitable for various use cases, from logistics and route planning to personal travel apps.\n    \n- **Accurate**: Offers high accuracy in distance and time calculations by leveraging well-established formulas and speed estimates.\n    \n- **Scalable**: Designed to handle high numbers of requests, ideal for high-traffic applications or businesses that require real-time location-based data.\n    \n- **Easy Integration**: The API is designed to be simple to integrate into any web or mobile application, with responses provided in easily consumable JSON format.\n    \n- **Global Coverage**: Can be used for locations around the world, as long as valid latitude and longitude coordinates are provided.\n    \n\n#### API Endpoints:\n\n1. **Distance and Time Calculation**:\n    \n    -
